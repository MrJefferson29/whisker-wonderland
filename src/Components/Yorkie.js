            Beneath the dainty, glossy, floor-length coat of a Yorkshire Terrier
            beats the heart of a feisty, old-time terrier. Yorkies earned their
            living as ratters in mines and mills long before they became the
            beribboned lapdogs of Victorian ladies. The Yorkshire Terrier is a
            compact, toy-size terrier of no more than seven pounds whose
            crowning glory is a floor-length, silky coat of steel blue and a
            rich golden tan. Don't let the Yorkie's daintiness fool you.
            Tenacious, feisty, brave, and sometimes bossy, the Yorkie exhibits
            all the traits of a true terrier. Often named the most popular dog
            breed in various American cities, Yorkies pack lots of big-town
            attitude into a small but self-important package. They are favorites
            of urbanites the world over. Yorkies are long-lived and
            hypoallergenic (the coat is more like human hair than animal fur),
            and they make fine little watchdogs. This is a true 'personality
            breed,'¬ù providing years of laughs, love, and close companionship.
