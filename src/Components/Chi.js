            The Chihuahua is a tiny dog with a huge personality. A national
            symbol of Mexico, these alert and amusing "purse dogs" stand among
            the oldest breeds of the Americas, with a lineage going back to the
            ancient kingdoms of pre-Columbian times. The Chihuahua is a
            balanced, graceful dog of terrier-like demeanor, weighing no more
            than 6 pounds. The rounded "apple" head is a breed hallmark. The
            erect ears and full, luminous eyes are acutely expressive. Coats
            come in many colors and patterns, and can be long or short. The
            varieties are identical except for coat. Chihuahuas possess loyalty,
            charm, and big-dog attitude. Even tiny dogs require training, and
            without it this clever scamp will rule your household like a little
            Napoleon. Compact and confident, Chihuahuas are ideal city pets.
            They are too small for roughhousing with kids, and special care must
            be taken in cold weather, but Chihuahuas are adaptable'Â¿as long as
            they get lots of quality time in their preferred lap.
